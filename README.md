This is required alongside the [server](https://github.com/EmotionalLove/SMS_x_Discord). 

# Usage

Download the release from the releases tab in this repo and use `java -jar <the jar>.jar` to run it. A config will generate and it will exit. Edit the config with the desired information and then re-run it. Easy. You'll also have to set up and sign up for SendGrid.
